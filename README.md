# Youtube_data_Harvesting

Data Harvesting from YouTube:

Use the YouTube Data API to fetch information about channels, playlists, videos, and comments.
Extract relevant data such as channel details, playlist details, video details, and comment details using appropriate API endpoints.
Data Storage:

Choose suitable databases for storing the extracted data. This could involve both relational (e.g., MySQL) and NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) databases.
MongoDB can be used for storing semi-structured data such as video details and comment details.
MySQL can be used for structured data like channel details and playlist details. 

Now clean and organize the data for analysis
